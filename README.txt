I am working to create a clone or a system that functions similarly to the inventory system of classic WoW. 
Once I get that working, the plan is to start designing a crafting system, again much like the one of WoW.
This is solely for learning and fun, there is no profit plan, or plans for future implentation. Though if the system beceomes complex enough it may take on a life of it's own.
